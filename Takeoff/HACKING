[+] Coding Style:

    Please, if you want to send a patch, follow the Qt/KDE coding style:
    
      http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/Qt_Coding_Style
      http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style

    In addition:
    
      - Limit the number of characters per line to 80
      - If is neccessary, make Doxygen documentation
      - Maintain this order in the methods of the header files:
      
          public (Constructors, destructor, public methods, getters/setters)
          protected
          public slots
          signals
          private slots
          private (Private methods, private variables)

      - Use "comment tags" in the source files to make easy find the
        implementation of the methods in this order:

          ANONYMOUS NAMESPACE
          STATIC METHODS AND VARIABLES
          CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTOR
          PUBLIC METHODS
          PROTECTED METHODS
          PUBLIC SLOTS
          PRIVATE SLOTS
          PRIVATE METHODS
          GET/SET/IS

    Remember that you can use astyle to indent the code automatically:

    astyle --style=k/r --indent=spaces=4 --convert-tabs \
       --pad-header --unpad-paren \
       --keep-one-line-blocks --align-pointer=name \
       --max-instatement-indent=8 --indent-col1-comments \
       --suffix=none \
       `find -type f -name '*.cpp'` `find -type f -name '*.h'`


[+] Understanding the Code:

    All the code is documented with Doxygen. If want to see this documentation
    in html format, go to the ./documentation folder and run:

      $ doxygen doxyfile

    Open the ./documentation/html/index.html file is a good place to begin.
